        "We take our freedoms for granted. For those under 50 years of age living in the United States and similar democratic nation states, it is easy to assume that the present political, social, and economic environment is how it has always been. Yet, humanity's history tells us just the oppositeâ€”relative peace is not the norm; war and strife are.",

        "As generations before us grappled with the horrors of two world wars and countless other regional battles, we too find ourselves at an inflection point. We are descending into another dark moment on this collective home we call Earth. Regional conflicts are tearing at the fabrics that we have worked so hard to create, and the voices of the majority, who we know desire peace, are drowned out by a small, but powerful minority who fan the flames.",
        "Pledge 4 Peace understands that peace is not a natural state. If we desire peace, we must work for it, create incentives to curb conflict, and produce meaningful initiatives that will naturally drive individuals to pursue peace as the only objective. The alternative is something unimaginable.",
        "We are a group of Peace Advocates. We have worked tirelessly in the last few weeks and launched Pledge4Peace.org with a sincere hope to halt further atrocities and resolve the 75+ year-old Israel and Palestine issue. If you like our idea of making peace through pledge, please like us on Facebook and pledge on this website. If you have any reservations or do not support the idea, we value your feedback to guide us in correcting our path and making improvements. Please give us 100% anonymous feedback by sending us an email at info@pledge4peace.org. This is your opportunity to contribute to the success and become a peacemaker, with the chance to reap great returns.",
